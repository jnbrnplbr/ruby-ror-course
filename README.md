# Ruby Programming and Ruby on Rails Bundle Lesson


## Key Learnings
- Displaying data or information.
```ruby
    print "Any data or information"         # the keyword "print" prints the string without adding newline in the end
    puts "Print any data or information"    # while "puts" always add a newline in the end
```
- Everything in ruby is an object.
- String interpolation - where you can directly insert a certain value or variable inside a string.
```ruby
    num = 100
    puts "the num value is #{num} and added with 10 is #{num + 10}" 
    #OUTPUT: the num value is 100 and added with 10 is 110
```
